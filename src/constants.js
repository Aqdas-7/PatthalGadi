      "Nestled along the banks of the sacred Ganges River, Banaras (or Varanasi) emerges as a city that transcends time. Its streets, a maze of ancient alleys, bear witness to millennia of history, culture, and spirituality. But beyond its religious significance and bustling markets lies a treasure trove of aesthetics that captivate the soul. One cannot talk about Banaras without delving into its vibrant tapestry of colors. Every corner, from the bustling ghats to the serene temples, is awash with hues that reflect the city's rich cultural tapestry. Saffron robes of sadhus mingle with the deep reds of sindoor and the myriad shades of silk sarees that adorn local women. The kaleidoscope of colors is not just a visual treat but a testament to the city's deep-rooted traditions and timeless elegance.",

    description:
      "The Tapin project, encompassing South and North mines, operated by Central Coalfields Limited (CCL), is located in the West Bokaro coalfields within Jharkhand's Hazaribagh district, approximately 10 kilometers from Charhi block. The mines are significant for their rich deposits of three-grade bituminous coal, serving as a fundamental energy source for various industries across the country. Despite its economic importance, the Tapin project faces critical environmental and safety challenges during its operational phases. The issue of pollution control and safety measures has been inadequately addressed, leading to substantial local concerns and adverse impacts. CCL's 2006 report pledged regular pollution control checks and daily water sprinkling to mitigate dust in nearby villages. However, on-ground observations reveal these measures are largely absent in the Tapin region. Clean drinking water supply to affected villages remains an unfulfilled promise, significantly impacting local communities. Reports indicate a stark disparity between claimed safety precautions and actual practices within the mines. Many workers lack essential safety gear such as masks and boots, exposing them to hazardous working conditions. Unchecked blasting operations have led to structural damage in nearby houses, endangering residents and contributing to health risks. In a collaborative report with the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2016, CCL asserted control over pollution levels and adherence to safety protocols during operations. However, ground assessments contradict these claims, highlighting systemic failures in regulatory oversight and enforcement. The adverse conditions imposed by the Tapin project extend beyond immediate operational areas. Nearby villagers endure heightened health risks, displacement threats, and housing instability due to unchecked mining practices and inadequate mitigation efforts. The situation surrounding the Tapin project is dire, marked by significant environmental degradation, compromised safety standards for workers, and detrimental impacts on local communities. Urgent intervention is imperative to enforce existing regulations, implement robust pollution control measures, and safeguard the well-being of affected populations.",

      "Kaile, nestled within the heart of Hazaribagh wildlife sanctuary, exudes a serene beauty surrounded by dense deciduous forests. Once teeming with diverse wildlife, including majestic tigers, this village of about 200 residents, predominantly Kurmis, relies heavily on agriculture for their livelihoods. However, Kaile's picturesque days contrast sharply with its nights. For nearly 70 years, the village has been cloaked in darkness due to the absence of electricity. As the sun sets, fear grips the villagers, wary of wild animal attacks lurking in the shadows, with snakes posing a constant threat. While the government has installed some solar lights at lane entrances, these provide only minimal illumination. Many villagers have borrowed solar panels, despite their costliness, to power basic necessities like mobile phone charging and fleeting hours of light from solar bulbs. Inside their homes, families still rely on kerosene lamps ('dhibri'), even though kerosene isn't subsidized on their ration cards. Repeated pleas to authorities—from the forest department to the Block Development Officer (BDO) and even the District Magistrate—have fallen on deaf ears. Only sporadic coverage in local newspapers brings intermittent attention to their plight. Despite their enduring hardship, the people of Kaile remain hopeful. They await a resolution, yearning for the day when their village will finally be illuminated, casting out the darkness that has enveloped them for generations.",

      "The Isko Caves are located in a remote village called Isko, about 45 km from Hazaribagh town and 15 km from Barkagaon block. The caves are situated in a dense forest area, surrounded by hills and streams. It is considered to be a site of archaeological significance, with evidence of human habitation dating back to the Stone Age.  Isko Village is famous for its rock paintings which are said to be of the mid-stone age. Archaeologists excavated the site and found that an ancient civilization used to reside in this area from 250,000 BP, and these paintings are from the Meso-chalcolithic period (9000-5000 BCE), while some experts believe these paintings are from the late Stone Age period (20000-25000 BCE). These caves were discovered by Bulu Imam, an environmental activist working for the protection of tribal culture and heritage in Jharkhand, in 1991. Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand is home to several Indo-Austric linguistic Families. In the North Karanpura valley which lies on the southern extremity of the Hazaribagh plateau, there are several villages like Isko where Munda, Birhor, and Oraon live. In some of the villages, these ethnic groups practice mural art and rituals related to the nearby rock art sites. Their valuable cultural heritage is still alive in their mural art and rituals. Basically, the mural paintings of this area are divided into two categories- Khovar and Sohrai. Both of them have specific meanings and are used in a socio-religious aspect. They believe that these rock art sites belong to their ancestors and their village deity who protect them.",

    title: "Bah Cow Story",
    url: "/story5",
    description:
      "The politics of Cow holds an ever looming presence in the social imagination of India. Though the issue was always present, but since the time of Modi government, the issue of the protection of cows have reached at a point of polarization between Hindus and Muslims. This phenomenon is explicitly visible in Uttar Pradesh under Yogi Government after 2017. The coming of BJP at the centre in 2014 and Uttar Pradesh in 2017 saw the subsequent rise of cow vigilante groups which function both informally as well as at formal level, claiming to work in close collaboration with the police in curbing the illegal slaughter of cow. Though in 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that each state should appoint a police inspector in each district who take strict action against these cow vigilantes, but no such policy has been proposed by the governments and in lack of such control over cow vigilantes, they have created a de facto cow terrorism. The cow terrorism has paved the way for bifurcation of communities on communal lines, and tacitly giving communal validation for the lynching of Muslims and Dalits for allegedly eating beef or slaughtering cows. The work of cow vigilantes who claim to labour for the betterment of the condition of cows cannot be far from truth when the condition of cows are considered in the region of Bah, a Vidhan Sabha constituency in Agra. These cow vigilantes threaten people and farmers and stop any trade of cows who are not producing milk in the areas. This has become a problem for the farmers who are unable to keep the unproductive cows with them as it cost them money and don’t give any profit. So, these farmers are forced to leave such cows on the streets as stray. This has produced a result where there are more stray cows and without any proper mechanism to shelter them, they have become a threat to the fields of the farmers. The people of Bah primarily rely on farming and live stocks for their livelihood. The issue of cow was a fundamental factor in the victory of BJP in Bah in the Assembly election of 2017. One of the many promises in the manifesto of BJP was for the protection of cows. It was said that ‘Gaushalas’ will be constructed which will serve as safe haven for the holy cow. But, the promises are still not fulfilled and people are kept in wait. The government’s ban on slaughter of cow have increased the percentage of stray cows by 117 per cent in rural UP in 2019 and without any proper shelter and availability of food, these left-outs and un-mastered cows on the streets, have become a menace for the people. Bah covers the region of Chambal and in the absence of any industrial development and employment opportunity, the people primarily rely on farming and live stocks as their livelihood. But the ban on slaughterhouses and the unofficial ban on their trade, stray cows have become a menace for the farmers. Due to the excess of the number of stray cattle, farmers are facing a lot of problem. Cattle which lose the capacity to give milk are left on the streets where they roam and destroy the fields, graze the crops causing much damage to the farmers. The problem of stray cattle is so big, some farmer lose their entire crop because of them. A village farmer informed. He added, “We have to wake up all night to protect our fields. We are using everything but to no avail.The livelihood of farmers depend on the safety of their crop for which they use wires, and fencing to protect their fields. Even after multiple visits to Lucknow, their issue has not been addressed by the government Yogi Government promised us gaushala, but no action is visible on the ground. It is not that we do not support cow protection, but there should be proper place for them to take shelter, otherwise they will just become a problem for us Yogi government after 2017 proposed to build cow protection centers and new gaushalas which will serve as safe haven for cows who are left on the streets. According to a report of Article-14, the government spend around Rs 764 crore from 2017 to 2020 on gaushalas. In 2021-22, the government allocated Rs 390 crore for the maintenance of gaushalas, but the people are still oblivious of any gaushala in the area.The yogi government fooled us. They have not done anything for us and our concerns. Our cows die almost every day on the streets because of some accident. People have also died. But, nothing concrete has happened  Amit, a local farmer spoke to us. Locals spoke of the condition prior to UP election, 2017 when cows who become unproductive were sold hence there was no issue of stray cattle roaming on the streets and eating the crop. But that situation was disturbed by the magnification on the issue of cow protection by the present government. Presently, such situation has occurred that there is nowhere these cattle can be kept or sold. Hence, the issue of crop grazing cattle has gained so much importance in the area. The continuous lynching that was done in the name of cow has developed fear in the minds of people here, who are caught in the perplexing condition where they cannot even sold the cow or keep it for themselves. So they let it roam un-mastered causing much distress to the farmers and their fields. Though an ordinance was cleared by the UP government on 2020 that prevent the slaughter of cow, with 10 years of rigorous imprisonment or Rs. 5 lack fine for putting life of a cow in danger, but in the absence of any gaushala to shelter them, the question still remains where they will go. That is not addressed by the present government.The ordinance which was passed will prove to be detrimental for the farmers, furthermore aggravating their concern. With this ordinance, rules for the protection of cows will be strengthened without providing adequate measures for the safety of the fields. Without any proper rehabilitation, increase in the number of cows will add to the woes of the farmers. Farmers are in distress and waiting for the government to take action on the matter. Though the government has consistently denied any such problem, stating that cows are being properly handled under gaushalas, the reports on the ground speak a different picture. The condition of cows have actually deteriorated rather than improved as there is no body to look after their maintenance. This problem does not stand alone as the farmers are the worst hit by the increase in the population of stray cows. The inaction of the government on the critical question of cow maintenance and protection while at the same time looking after the concerns of farmers is indicating that the politics of cow is just another category for electoral mobilization of Hindu community who perceive cows as sacred to create a polarization for winning election.",
